    <hr>
    <a href="https://github.com/ThatGuyAstral/">I</a> am a small programmer with many dreams wishing to be accomplished. Well, some have already been accomplished.<br>At first, I programmed in Python. I made console applications then started using a 3D Library called Ursina to make a minecraft clone. <br>Then, I tried C#. Didn't know alot, until now. I figured out I/O and other stuff, and even motivated me to make NovaOS.<br>And now, I'm learning C++. It's okay, I know variables, printing and inputs, but i have way more to learn.
